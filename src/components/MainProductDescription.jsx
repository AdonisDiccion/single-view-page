        <p>
          Shimano ICE Technology advances in its Saint group debut, further
          reducing heat through combined features in the brake pads, BR-M820
          caliper and new exclusive Saint rotor design. The new shorter BL-M820
          brake lever is lighter and more ergonomic. Saint ICE Technology disc
          brakes are race proven on the world cup circuit where World Cup
          Champion Aaron Gwin raced and won with prototype versions of the brake
          you can buy for your own rig. Front brake is pre-bled, rear brake is
          disconnected to allow for easier internal frame routing. Includes:
          caliper, lever, hose and one set of metallic brake pads. Rotor and
          adapter sold separately.{" "}
